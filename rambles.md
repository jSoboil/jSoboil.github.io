### *Reflections on the basic properties of numbers:*
There are certain things I sometimes wish I had learned in school. But, perhaps I wouldn't have understood it then. Now that I am older, and have unexpectedly developed a deep intrigue for mathematics, perhaps my ability to appreciate some basic mathematical proofs has grown. Undoubtedly, it is the latter.

I am currently working through the 4th Ed. of Michael Spivak's '*Calculus*'. Spivak presents calculus beautifully, with great prose. Importantly, I believe, is Spivak's implicit mathematical message: it is an art that rewards playfulness and tinkering. But, to return back to the meaning of this post, I thought it would be good to share and revise the 'basic properties of numbers' or, more specifically, arithmetic.

#### Property 1: the associative law for addition
If $$a$$, $$b$$, and $$c$$ are any numbers, then

$$a + (b+c) = (a+b) + c$$

#### Property 2: the existence of an additive identity
If $$a$$ is any number, then

$$a + 0 = 0 + a = a$$

Following from this, an important role is also played by 0 in the third property.

#### Property 3: the existence of additive inverses
For every number a, there is a number -a sich that

$$a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0$$

Thus, additive inverses are simply the addition of the negative, i.e. $$+ (-a)$$. It is therefore convenient to regard subtraction as an operation derived from addition. This means $$a - b$$ is an implicit abbreviation for $$a + (-b)$$. 

There now remains only one property of basic addition.

#### Property 4: the commutative law for addition
If $$a$$ and $$b$$ are any numbers, then

$$a + b = b + a$$

which emphasis that the operation of addition of pairs of numbers does not depend on the order of addition. However, not all operations are alike, for example $$a - b \not= b - a$$. Interestingly, $$a - b = b - a$$ only when $$a = b$$!
