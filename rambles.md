### *Reflections on the basic properties of numbers:*
There are certain things I sometimes wish I had learned in school. But, perhaps I wouldn't have understood it then. Now that I am older, and have unexpectedly developed a deep intrigue for mathematics, perhaps my ability to appreciate some basic mathematical proofs has grown. Undoubtedly, it is the latter.

I am currently working through the 4th Ed. of Michael Spivak's '*Calculus*'. Spivak presents calculus beautifully, with great prose. Importantly, I believe, is Spivak's implicit mathematical message: it is an art that rewards playfulness and tinkering. But, to return back to the meaning of this post, I thought it would be good to share and revise the 'basic properties of numbers' or, more specifically, arithmetic.

#### Property 1: the associative law for addition
If $a$, $b$, and $c$ are any numbers, then
$\begin{center}a + (b+c) = (a+b) + c\end{center}$
