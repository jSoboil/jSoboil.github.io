Some intermittent thoughts, primarily technical.

### *Reflections on the basic properties of numbers:*
There are certain things I sometimes wish I had learned in school. Maybe I wouldn't have understood it then however, due to my ADD which usually got in the way of me listening. Perhaps it was the teacher who was boring. Truthfully though, I usually found myself thinking of other things besides mathematics, as you can imagine. It is, of course, one of the mainstays of [ADD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_deficit_hyperactivity_disorder#Signs_and_symptoms). But, now that I am older I have unexpectedly developed a deep intrigue for mathematics, a tinkering obsession perhaps, and  my ability to appreciate some basic mathematical proofs has grown.

Hence, I am currently working through the 4th Ed. of Michael Spivak's '*Calculus*'. Spivak presents calculus beautifully, with great prose. Importantly, I think, is his implicit mathematical message: it is an art that rewards playfulness and tinkering. But, to return back to the point of this post (it's title), I thought it would be good to share and revise the 'basic properties of numbers' or, more specifically, the basic rules of arithmetic.

#### Property 1: the associative law for addition
If $$a$$, $$b$$, and $$c$$ are any numbers, then

$$a + (b+c) = (a+b) + c$$

#### Property 2: the existence of an additive identity
If $$a$$ is any number, then

$$a + 0 = 0 + a = a$$

Following from this, an important role is also played by 0 in the third property.

#### Property 3: the existence of additive inverses
For every number a, there is a number -a sich that

$$a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0$$

Thus, additive inverses are simply the addition of the negative, i.e. $$+ (-a)$$. It is therefore convenient to regard subtraction as an operation derived from addition. This means $$a - b$$ is an implicit abbreviation for $$a + (-b)$$. 

There now remains only one property of basic addition.

#### Property 4: the commutative law for addition
If $$a$$ and $$b$$ are any numbers, then

$$a + b = b + a$$

which emphasis that the operation of addition of pairs of numbers does not depend on the order of addition. However, not all operations are alike, for example $$a - b \not= b - a$$. Interestingly, $$a - b = b - a$$ only when $$a = b$$!

However, to go further, into multiplication and division, we need a little more.

#### Property 5: the associative law for multiplication
Fortunately, Spivak notes, the basic properties of multiplication are so similar to those for addition that both the meaning and the consequences should be clear.

If $$a$$, $$b$$, and $$c$$ are any numbers, then

$$a\times (b\times c) = (a\times b)\times c$$
